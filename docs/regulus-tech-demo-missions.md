- **Success Criteria**: Successfully coordinate all gameplay systems to achieve a decisive victory

## Faction-Specific Mission Variants

Each mission can have faction-specific variants that maintain the same gameplay objectives but adjust the narrative framing and visual presentation:

### Meridian Corporation Context
- Resource-focused missions emphasize efficiency and profit margins
- Combat missions frame objectives in terms of market control and asset protection
- Command missions emphasize corporate hierarchy and strategic ROI

### Coalition of Free Miners Context
- Resource-focused missions emphasize community needs and worker safety
- Combat missions frame objectives as defending hard-won freedom
- Command missions emphasize democratic decision-making and collective effort

### The Luminous Path Context
- Resource-focused missions emphasize Unobtanium's consciousness-expanding properties
- Combat missions frame objectives as creating harmony or dispelling disruptive energies
- Command missions emphasize spiritual guidance and enlightened purpose

## Development Priority Suggestion

For efficient development, consider implementing the missions in this order:

1. **First Phase (Core Systems)**: Missions 1, 3, 5
2. **Second Phase (Expanded Mechanics)**: Missions 2, 4, 6
3. **Third Phase (Team Dynamics)**: Missions 7, 9, 11
4. **Final Phase (Integration)**: Missions 8, 10, 12, 13

This approach builds systems progressively while allowing for testing and refinement at each stage.

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Reuse mission areas where possible by changing time of day, weather conditions, or enemy positions
- Create modular AI behaviors that can be combined and reused across missions
- Design mission objectives that can test individual systems in isolation before combining them
- Consider implementing a scoring system for each mission to encourage replayability

## Future Expansion Potential

- **Environmental Challenge Missions**: Showcase special environmental hazards
- **Biome-Specific Missions**: Highlight the different regions of Regulus
- **Research & Development Missions**: Focus on unlocking new technologies and equipment
- **Rank Progression Missions**: Special challenges that grant rank advancement
- **Moral Choice Missions**: Scenarios where the player must choose between faction ideology and personal morality
