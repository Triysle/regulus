```
                  ┌─────────────────┐
                  │  Game Manager   │
                  └─────────────────┘
                           │
           ┌───────────────┼────────────────┐

                 └──────────────────┘
                          │
                          ▼
                  ┌─────────────┐
                  │Database Layer│
                  └─────────────┘
```

### Core Singleton Structure
The game will use the following autoload/singleton patterns:
- **GameManager**: Central coordinator for all game systems
- **NetworkManager**: Handles all multiplayer communication
- **ResourceManager**: Manages game resources and economy
- **WorldManager**: Controls zone loading and territory
- **UIManager**: Handles interface and player feedback
- **PlayerManager**: Tracks player data and state
- **SquadManager**: Coordinates team organization

### Scene Structure
Godot's scene system will be leveraged with:
- **Standalone scenes**: Reusable elements (weapons, vehicles, UI components)
- **Composition scenes**: Objects composed of multiple elements
- **Level scenes**: Complete zones with terrain and gameplay elements
- **Manager scenes**: Specialized controllers for subsystems

## 3. Core Systems Implementation

### Player Controller

#### Architecture
The player controller will be implemented as a CharacterBody3D with child components:

- **InputHandler**: Processes local player input
- **Movement**: Handles locomotion and physics
- **Inventory**: Manages player equipment and resources
- **NetworkSync**: Handles state synchronization
- **CombatSystem**: Processes damage and health

#### Key Features
- First-person movement with configurable parameters
- Client-side prediction with server reconciliation
- Shield and health system with regeneration mechanics
- State-based animation system for smooth transitions
- Network-optimized collision detection

### Combat System

#### Weapon Architecture
- Modular weapon system with inheritance for specialized types
- Three primary weapon categories: kinetic, energy, explosive
- Data-driven design with weapon properties in resource files
- Client-side effects with server-validated hits

#### Damage System
- Centralized DamageManager to calculate final damage
- Different damage types with varied effects on shields vs. health
- Area effect calculation for explosives and splash damage
- Faction-based friendly fire rules

### Networking

#### Client-Server Model
Regulus will use a client-server architecture with authoritative server:

- **Server**: Manages authoritative game state
- **Client**: Handles input, prediction, and rendering
- **Protocol**: Custom binary protocol over ENet UDP

#### Optimization Techniques
- **Interest Management**: Only send updates about entities relevant to each player
- **Delta Compression**: Send only changes rather than full state
- **Message Batching**: Group small messages into larger packets
- **Area of Interest**: Divide world into cells for relevance filtering

#### Synchronization Approach
- Position updates use interpolation for smooth movement
- Critical actions (shooting, abilities) use immediate processing
- Periodic full-state synchronization to correct drift
- Client-side prediction with server validation

### World Management

#### Zone System
The world is divided into connected zones for better performance:

- **Zone Structure**: Self-contained scenes with terrain and gameplay elements
- **Streaming**: Dynamic loading/unloading based on player proximity
- **Persistence**: Database storage for territory control between sessions
- **Boundaries**: Seamless transitions between active zones

#### Capture Mechanics
- **Control Points**: Strategic locations that can be captured
- **Faction Control**: Percentage-based territory ownership
- **Benefits**: Resource generation and spawn advantages
- **Visual Feedback**: Environment changes based on controlling faction

### Squad and Team Systems

#### Organization Structure
- **Command Element**: 2-player leadership team per faction
- **Squad System**: 3 squads of 10 players each per faction
- **Squad Leader**: Special abilities and command tools
- **Member Tracking**: Squad-specific HUD elements and minimap icons

#### Communication Tools
- **Ping System**: Context-sensitive marking system
- **Objective Markers**: Command-assigned mission indicators
- **Status Updates**: Automated squad status notifications
- **Resource Sharing**: Squad-based resource distribution

### Resource and Construction Systems

#### Resource Flow
- Raw Unobtanium → Refined Unobtanium → Construction Materials/Energy
- Resource nodes with regeneration mechanisms
- Player inventory with weight limitations
- Faction resource pools for shared structures

#### Construction Mechanics
- Blueprint placement with validation
- Construction progress visualization
- Faction-specific appearance modifications
- Functional benefits based on structure type
