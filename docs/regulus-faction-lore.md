# REGULUS: BATTLE FOR UNOBTANIUM
## Faction Lore Blurbs

## THE LUMINOUS PATH

What began as a humble research collective studying the strange properties of Unobtanium has blossomed into something far greater. The Luminous Path emerged from the ashes of Earth's collapse when a group of xenobiologists, physicists, and consciousness researchers discovered something extraordinary: prolonged exposure to raw Unobtanium altered human perception in ways that transcended mere hallucination.

Led by the enigmatic Oracle Sera Lumen—once a brilliant but conventional scientist—the Luminous Path views Unobtanium not as a resource to be exploited, but as a gateway to humanity's evolution. After her transformative experience with the crystal, Sera's mind expanded beyond conventional understanding, granting her insights that seemed to border on the prophetic.

"The crystal does not merely reflect light," Oracle Lumen often reminds her followers, "it reflects consciousness back upon itself, revealing pathways previously hidden."

The Luminous Path structures itself as a communal society guided by a council of the "Enlightened"—those who have undergone extensive Unobtanium exposure and integration rituals. Their settlements blend harmoniously with Regulus's environment, particularly in the Adaptive Forests where their structures seem to grow from the land itself, adorned with flowing designs in their signature green and purple.

Unlike their adversaries who seek to control or profit from Unobtanium, the Path seeks to understand its deepest nature. Their equipment appears almost biological, with organic curves and surfaces that pulse with gentle light. Their devotees move with purpose through the crystalline landscapes of Regulus, establishing "harmony nodes" at intersections of natural energy currents.

The Path's critics dismiss them as delusional mystics, but those who have witnessed their abilities in the field know better. Their deep connection to Unobtanium grants them unique insights into its manipulation, allowing them to achieve effects that other factions struggle to replicate through technology alone.

As tensions escalate into open conflict across Regulus, the Luminous Path stands ready to defend their vision of a transcendent future—one where humanity evolves beyond its limitations through communion with the crystal. Their mantra echoes across their settlements and battlefields alike:

"Illuminate The Path Forward."

## THE MERIDIAN CORPORATION

From the ashes of corporate ambition, the Meridian Corporation emerged as the last bastion of Earth's organizational efficiency on Regulus. When communications with the homeworld faltered during The Collapse, the various corporate security forces made a calculated decision: merge or perish. What began as a survival pact quickly evolved into the most structured and technologically advanced faction on the planet.

Under the steely leadership of Director Eliza Vex—once a corporate security specialist renowned for her tactical brilliance—Meridian operates with clockwork precision. Their hierarchy leaves no room for ambiguity, with clear chains of command extending from their board of directors down to the newest recruits deployed to secure Unobtanium deposits.

"Efficiency is not merely a goal," Director Vex often declares during shareholder briefings, "it is the only path to survival and eventual dominance in this new frontier."

Meridian's installations stand in stark contrast to the wild landscapes of Regulus—angular structures of gleaming white and blue, manufactured to exacting specifications. Their settlements expand with mathematical precision, each new building placed according to long-term strategic plans that may span decades.

Unlike their competitors who view Unobtanium through ideological lenses, Meridian approaches the resource with pragmatic clarity. Every gram extracted feeds into their meticulously calculated economic projections. Their equipment bears the hallmark of mass production—sleek, standardized, and optimized for performance rather than individual expression.

Meridian's critics condemn them as soulless opportunists, but those who have faced their forces in the field know the danger of underestimating their methodical approach. Their combat tactics leverage advanced technology and precise coordination that other factions struggle to match.

As resource conflicts intensify across Regulus, the Meridian Corporation advances its vision of a corporate state that might one day reconnect with and perhaps even save a fractured Earth. Their recruitment posters and battle standards all prominently display their unwavering motto:

"Progress Through Order."

## THE COALITION OF FREE MINERS

Born in the grit and determination of Regulus's working class, the Coalition of Free Miners represents the unbreakable spirit of those who refused to bow to corporate dominance after Earth's collapse. What started as scattered acts of resistance—work slowdowns and resource hoarding among mining crews—coalesced into a movement under the passionate leadership of Foreman Jace Redrock.

"Those who extract the crystal, those who bleed for it—they alone should determine its fate," Redrock proclaimed during the historic Crystalline Plains revolt that marked the Coalition's true beginning. Once a simple crew leader with a talent for inspiring loyalty, Redrock now guides the Coalition with the same straightforward honesty that won him his first followers.

Unlike the rigid structures of their adversaries, the Coalition operates through democratic consensus, with representatives elected from each settlement, mining outpost, and worker collective. Their meetings—often held in circular chambers where no voice carries more weight by position—can be chaotic but generate solutions with broad support.

The Coalition's settlements reflect their practical philosophy—structures built for function over form, often repurposed from abandoned mining equipment and weathered by Regulus's elements. Their signature orange and brown colors come not from aesthetic choice but practical reality: the omnipresent dust of mining operations that stains everything in their territory.

While other factions view Unobtanium through the lens of profit or transcendence, the Coalition sees it simply: a resource that belongs to those who work to extract it. Their equipment bears the marks of countless repairs and modifications, each piece customized by its user for their specific needs—no two Coalition miners carry identical gear.

Critics dismiss them as disorganized rabble, but those who have faced Coalition forces in battle know the formidable strength of their unity. What they lack in standardization they make up for in innovation and adaptability, with weapons and vehicles creatively modified beyond their original specifications.

As resource wars intensify across Regulus, the Coalition fights not for abstract ideals but for the tangible freedom of their communities—self-governing settlements where the fruits of labor are shared among those who produce them. Their rallying cry echoes through the mining tunnels and across contested territories:

"Together We Endure."
