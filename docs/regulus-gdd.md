# Regulus Tech Demo - Game Design Document

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for a minimal viable product (MVP) of the Regulus Tech Demo, focusing on demonstrating core gameplay mechanics while maintaining realistic scope for a solo developer.

### Core Concept
First-person resource collection and base building game with combat elements in a sci-fi setting on the exoplanet Regulus.

### Development Constraints
- Solo developer
- 3-4 month development timeline
- Single playable mission/scenario
- Focused mechanics implementation

## 2. Core Gameplay Features

### 2.1 Player Systems
- First-person movement and interaction
- Three-tier defensive system (shield, armor, health)
- Three weapon types (kinetic, energy, explosive)
- Resource collection capabilities

### 2.2 Resource System
- Single resource type (Unobtanium)
- Nodes for collection in the environment
- Resource as currency for construction

### 2.3 Construction System
- 2-3 buildable structures
- Predefined foundation locations
- Basic defensive capabilities

### 2.4 Vehicle System
- Single medium transport/combat vehicle
- Basic physics and controls
- Resource collection functionality
- Enter/exit mechanics

### 2.5 Enemy System
- 2 enemy types with distinct behaviors
- Basic AI for combat and patrolling
- Clear visual distinction between types

## 3. World and Environment

### 3.1 Setting
- Crystalline Plains biome from existing documentation
- Meridian Corporation faction perspective
- Limited area with focused gameplay zone

### 3.2 Art Style
- Low-poly, clean visual style
- Blue/white color scheme for player faction
- Distinct visual language for environment vs. structures

### 3.3 Level Design
- Single mission area (~2-3kmÂ²)
- Clear driving paths/roads connecting key locations
- Open areas for vehicle maneuverability 
- Strategic resource node placement
- Varied terrain for tactical options
- Predefined construction zones
- Natural boundaries (cliffs, ravines) to limit the playable area

## 4. Mission and Objectives

### 4.1 Main Objective
- Establish and defend a functional outpost
- Collect sufficient resources to complete all constructions
- Repel waves of enemy attacks

### 4.2 Gameplay Loop
1. Collect Unobtanium from resource nodes
2. Construct and upgrade defensive structures
3. Defend against increasingly difficult enemy waves
4. Expand collection capabilities with vehicle
5. Complete final defensive stand

### 4.3 Success Criteria
- All required structures built
- Final enemy wave defeated
- Minimum resource stockpile achieved

## 5. Technical Implementation

### 5.1 Core Architecture
- CharacterBody3D for player controller
- Area3D for resource nodes and interaction zones
- VehicleBody3D for simplified vehicle physics
- State machine pattern for enemy AI
- Node structure following Godot best practices

### 5.2 Key Systems
- Health/Shield/Armor using custom resource classes
- Resource collection using Area3D interactions
- Construction using ray-casting for placement
- Vehicle interaction with proximity prompts

### 5.3 Performance Considerations

- Level of detail (LOD) implementation for distance objects
- Efficient lighting and shadow setup
- Culling optimization

## 6. User Interface

### 6.1 HUD Elements

- Controls reference screen

### 6.3 Feedback Systems
- Visual damage indicators
- Resource collection confirmation
- Construction placement feedback
- Enemy awareness indicators

## 7. Audio Design

### 7.1 Sound Categories
- Weapon sounds (firing, reloading, impact)
- Vehicle sounds (engine, movement)
- Environmental ambience
- UI feedback sounds
- Enemy sounds

### 7.2 Implementation
- AudioStreamPlayer3D for spatial sounds
- AudioStreamPlayer for UI elements
- Bus structure for volume control
- Dynamic audio based on gameplay state

## 8. Development Roadmap

### 8.1 Phase 1: Core Mechanics
