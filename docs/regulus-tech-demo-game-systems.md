# Regulus Tech Demo - Game Systems

## 1. Player Controller System

### Core Components
- First-person movement
- Shield/health/armor defensive layers
- Basic interaction mechanics
- Equipment management

### Defensive System
- **Shield**: Automatically regenerates
- **Armor**: Damage buffer, manual repair
- **Health**: Limited regeneration, item-based healing

### Damage Calculation
- Damage types: Kinetic, Energy, Explosive
- Different effectiveness against shield/armor/health
- Varied weapon impact based on target type

## 2. Weapon System

### Weapon Categories
1. **Kinetic Weapons**
   - High damage to health
   - Standard ballistic firearms
   - Medium range and accuracy

2. **Energy Weapons**
   - Effective against shields
   - Rapid-fire capabilities
   - Lower physical damage

3. **Explosive Weapons**
   - Area of effect damage
   - High armor penetration
   - Limited ammunition

### Weapon Attributes
- Damage output
- Fire rate
- Reload time
- Ammunition capacity
- Accuracy and recoil

## 3. Resource System

### Unobtanium Mechanics
- Primary in-game resource
- Collected from resource nodes
- Used for equipment and vehicle acquisition

### Resource Node Types
- Small nodes: Quick, low-yield extraction
- Medium nodes: Balanced resource potential
- Large nodes: Slow extraction, high total yield

### Resource Usage
- Equipment purchases
- Vehicle spawning
- Structure construction
- Support ability activation

## 4. Construction System

### Structure Types
1. **Defensive Structures**
   - Turrets
   - Barriers
   - Shield generators

2. **Utility Structures**
   - Repair stations
   - Ammunition dispensers
   - Spawn points

### Construction Mechanics
- Predefined foundation locations
- Resource-based building
- Faction-specific visual styles
- Basic upgrade capabilities

## 5. Vehicle System

### Vehicle Classes
1. **Light Vehicles**
   - High mobility
   - Low durability
   - Reconnaissance role

2. **Medium Vehicles**
   - Balanced performance
   - Versatile combat capabilities
   - Resource transport option

3. **Heavy Vehicles**
   - High durability
   - Significant firepower
   - Slow movement

### Vehicle Mechanics
- Basic physics
- Damage system
- Crew positions
- Resource extraction capability

## 6. Enemy AI System

### AI Behavior Types
- Patrol
- Combat engagement
- Defensive positioning
- Resource protection

### Combat Intelligence
- Target prioritization
- Basic threat assessment
- Simple flanking behaviors
- Varied response to player actions

## 7. Progression System

### Player Advancement
- Weapon unlocks
- Equipment upgrades
- Basic skill improvements

### Mission Progression
- Increasing difficulty
- New mechanics introduction
- Narrative progression

## 8. Technical Design Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Low-poly art style
- Efficient scene management
- Basic level-of-detail implementation

### Godot 4 Implementation
- CharacterBody3D for player
- Component-based design
- State machine for AI behaviors
