# REGULUS TECH DEMO - PROJECT OUTLINE

## Overview
This project outline defines the scope and implementation approach for the Regulus Tech Demo, a single-player PvE experience demonstrating the core gameplay systems of the full Regulus FPS concept. The tech demo will serve as a proof-of-concept for key mechanics while maintaining the established lore, visual style, and design direction.

## 1. Core Systems to Implement

### 1.1 Combat System
- Player controller with shield/health/armor three-tier defensive system
- Three weapon categories: kinetic, energy, and explosive with differentiated damage types
- Enemy AI with basic combat behaviors
- Weapon selection and ammo management

### 1.2 Vehicle System
- Three vehicle classes: light, medium, and heavy
- Vehicle controls and physics
- Specialized vehicle types including combat and resource extraction vehicles
- Vehicle damage system mirroring player defense layers

### 1.3 Resource System
- Unobtanium extraction via specialized vehicles
- Resource node types and distribution
- Resource transportation and storage
- Resource as currency for construction and equipment

### 1.4 Construction System
- Building placement on predefined foundations
- Structure types: defensive, utility, resource, and vehicle support
- Upgrade and repair mechanics
- Faction-specific visual styles for identical functional structures

### 1.5 Squad and Command System
- Basic AI squad members with command response
- Tactical positioning and coordination
- Support abilities triggered by team leaders
- Simplified version of the full command structure

### 1.6 Territory Control System
- Capture point mechanics
- Control point progression
- Strategic benefits from territory ownership
- Simplified version of the lattice-based system

## 2. Mission Structure

The tech demo will feature a 13-mission progression organized into four phases:

### Phase 1: Core Mechanics (Missions 1-3)
- Introduce basic combat, vehicles, and resource systems

### Phase 2: System Expansion (Missions 4-6)
- Expand gameplay with resource logistics, weapon specialization, and construction

### Phase 3: Advanced Systems (Missions 7-9)
- Implement squad tactics, territory control, and vehicle specialization

### Phase 4: System Integration (Missions 10-13)
- Combine all systems into complex scenarios with increasing challenge

## 3. Development Priorities

### Priority 1: Core Player Experience
- Player controller and combat feel
- Vehicle controls and functionality
- Basic enemy AI

### Priority 2: Resource & Construction Loop
- Resource extraction and transport
- Basic construction system
- Simplified economy

### Priority 3: Tactical Gameplay
- Squad command system
- Territory control mechanics
- Advanced mission objectives

### Priority 4: Integration and Polish
- Faction-specific elements
- Mission progression system
- UI and tutorial elements

## 4. Technical Implementation (Godot 4)

### 4.1 Core Architecture
- Character controller using CharacterBody3D
- Vehicle physics using VehicleBody3D
- Modular weapon system with inheritance
- Component-based structure system
- State machine for AI behaviors

### 4.2 Scene Structure
- Main game manager scene
- Player and vehicle scenes
- Mission controller scenes
- UI overlay scene

### 4.3 System Implementation
- Data-driven design for weapons, vehicles, and structures
- Node-based construction system
- Navigation mesh for AI pathfinding
- Resource manager singleton
- Mission progression system using scene transitions

### 4.4 Asset Requirements
- Low-poly stylized models for characters, vehicles, and structures
- Faction-specific visual variants
- Effect systems for weapons and abilities
- UI elements for game systems
- Basic environmental assets for mission areas

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 System Testing
- Isolated testing of individual mechanics
- Combat balance verification
- AI behavior testing
- Vehicle physics tuning

### 5.2 Mission Testing
- Playthrough testing for each mission
- Objective clarity verification
- Difficulty curve assessment
- System integration testing
