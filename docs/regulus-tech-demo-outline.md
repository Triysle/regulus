# Regulus Tech Demo - Project Outline

## 1. Project Purpose
Develop a single-player PvE experience demonstrating core gameplay systems of the Regulus FPS concept, serving as a proof of concept for key mechanics.

## 2. Core Systems to Implement

### 2.1 Player Controller
- First-person movement
- Shield/health/armor three-tier defensive system
- Basic combat interactions
- Equipment management

### 2.2 Combat System
- Three weapon categories: kinetic, energy, explosive
- Differentiated damage types
- Basic enemy AI with combat behaviors
- Weapon selection and ammo management

### 2.3 Resource System
- Unobtanium extraction mechanics
- Resource node types
- Basic resource collection and transport
- Resource as currency for equipment

### 2.4 Construction System
- Building placement on predefined foundations
- Basic defensive and utility structures
- Simple upgrade and repair mechanics
- Faction-specific visual styles

### 2.5 Vehicle System
- Three vehicle classes: light, medium, heavy
- Basic vehicle controls and physics
- Simple damage system
- Resource extraction vehicle

## 3. Mission Structure
13 missions organized into four progressive phases:

### Phase 1: Core Mechanics (Missions 1-3)
- Introduce basic combat
- Weapon and damage system exploration
- Initial resource interactions

### Phase 2: System Expansion (Missions 4-6)
- Resource logistics
- Basic construction mechanics
- Initial squad interactions

### Phase 3: Advanced Systems (Missions 7-9)
- Squad tactics
- Territory control basics
- More complex combat scenarios

### Phase 4: System Integration (Missions 10-13)
- Combine all learned systems
- Increasing challenge and complexity
- Final demonstration of integrated gameplay

## 4. Technical Implementation (Godot 4)

### 4.1 Core Architecture
- CharacterBody3D for player controller
- Component-based design
- State machine for AI behaviors
- Modular weapon and vehicle systems

### 4.2 Performance Considerations
- Optimize for mid-range hardware
- Focus on clear, readable low-poly art style
- Efficient scene management
- Basic level-of-detail (LOD) implementation

## 5. Development Priorities

### Priority 1: Player Experience
- Tight player controls
- Clear feedback systems
- Intuitive mechanics

### Priority 2: Core Systems
- Weapon and combat feel
- Resource collection loop
- Basic AI behaviors

### Priority 3: Mission Design
- Progressive difficulty
- Clear objectives
- Varied gameplay scenarios
